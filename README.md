# Search and Rescue (SAR) Agent Framework - CSC 581

## Introduction

The First Aid Agent helps with providing first aid guidance and assessing medical triage levels. It can also combine a first aid query with a given triage level assessed and give a combined output. The agent has access to two data sources:
1. A json file consisting of possible first aid questions and their answers which are answered using fuzzy matching using difflib
2. A csv file consisting of patient info and assessed triage levels 

The agent uses OpenAI's API key to access the LLM to assess a triage level and provide a combined answer. 

## How to Submit
Please submit a link to your clone of the repository to Canvas. 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pyenv (recommended for Python version management)
- pip (for dependency management)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sar-project
```

2. Set up Python environment:
```bash
# Using pyenv (recommended)
pyenv install 3.9.6  # or your preferred version
pyenv local 3.9.6

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

4. Configure environment variables:

#### OpenAI:
- Obtain required API keys:
  1. OpenAI API key: Sign up at https://platform.openai.com/signup
- Update your `.env` file with the following:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```
#### Google Gemini:
- Obtain required API keys:
  1. ``` pip install google-generativeai ```
  2. ``` import google.generativeai as genai ```
  3. Google Gemini API Key: Obtain at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
- Configure with the following:
  ```
  genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))
  ```

Make sure to keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to version control.
